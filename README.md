# Mobile DevOps
This is the code repository for [Mobile DevOps](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/mobile-devops?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788296243), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
The main goal of this book is to teach developers to implement DevOps to build, test, and deliver. This book will teach you to implement Mobile DevOps at every stage of your application's lifecycle with Visual Studio and Xamarin Mobile Lifecycle solutions. Later, it will also show you how to leverage Mobile Center's continuous integration and automated testing to develop a high-quality applications. Next, you’ll see how to mobilize your on-premises data to the cloud and increase your productivity with code reuse. Finally, you’ll discover how to find and fix bugs beforehand, improving the efficiency of your application while it is being developed.

By the end of this book, you will be well-versed with Mobile DevOps techniques, delivering high quality and high performance mobile apps.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 1 to 3 doesn't contain code files

The code will look like the following:
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": "ec2:*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
```

This book assumes a medium-level knowledge of the Windows operating system and basic knowledge of cloud computing and the application development life cycle, and also beginner-level knowledge of object-oriented programming languages such as Java or C#. The book will go through various phases of the mobile DevOps life cycle, which requires a basic understanding of application development fundamentals and application delivery. If you have experience with Visual Studio and with programming with C#, this is a big plus.

The minimum requirements to install Visual Studio and Xamarin are as follows:

**Windows requirements: Windows 7 

**Android 6.0/API level 23


The following are the hardware requirements for Android Emulator:

**Hyper-V support 

**4 GB or more RAM  

**64-bit version of Windows OS

Note that since the Android SDK Emulator is prohibitively slow without hardware acceleration, Intel's Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager (HAXM) is the recommended way to drastically improve the performance of the Android Emulator.

Internet connectivity is required to install the necessary Visual Studio and Xamarin.Android packages and Git, and to connect with Xamarin Test Cloud.
